      introduction: |
        Welcome to OpenHistoricalMap, the free and editable map of world history. Now that you're signed
        up, you're all set to get started mapping. Here's a quick guide with the most important
        things you need to know.
      whats_on_the_map:
        title: What's on the Map
        on_the_map_html: |
          OpenHistoricalMap is a place for mapping things that are <em>in the past</em> -
          it includes buildings, roads, and other details about places. You can map
          whatever historical features are interesting to you. Please map from any old
          or out-of-copyright maps you can find. We're very import-friendly, as well.
        off_the_map_html: |
          What it <em>doesn't</em> include is opinionated data like ratings, and data
          from copyrighted sources.
      basic_terms:
        title: Basic Terms For Mapping
        paragraph_1: |
          OpenHistoricalMap uses the same lingo as OpenStreetMap (OSM). In general, if you have any
          questions, you can answer them with the same solutions as for OSM.
          Here are a few key words that'll come in handy.
        an_editor_html: An %{editor} is a program or website you can use to edit the map.
        a_node_html: A %{node} is a point on the map, like a single restaurant or a tree.
        a_way_html: A %{way} is a line or area, like a road, stream, lake or building.
        a_tag_html: A %{tag} is a bit of data about a node or way, like a restaurant's name or a road's speed limit.
        editor: editor
        node: node
        way: way
        tag: tag
      rules:
        title: Rules!
        para_1_html: |
          OpenHistoricalMap has few formal rules but we expect all participants to collaborate
          with, and communicate with, the community with courtesy and respect.
      start_mapping: Start Mapping
      add_a_note:
        title: No Time To Edit? Add a Note!
        para_1: |
          If you just want something small fixed and don't have the time to sign up and learn how to edit, it's
          easy to add a note.
        para_2_html: |
          Just go to %{map_link} and click the note icon: %{note_icon}.
          This will add a marker to the map, which you can move by dragging.
          Add your message, then click save, and other mappers will investigate.
