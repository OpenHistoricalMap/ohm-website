This is The Rails Port, the [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
application that powers the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) website and API.
The software is also known as "openstreetmap-website".

This repository consists of:

* The web site, including user accounts, diary entries, user-to-user messaging.
* The XML-based editing [API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6).
* The integrated version of the [iD](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ID) editors.
* The Browse pages - a web front-end to the OpenStreetMap data.
* The GPX uploads, browsing and API.

A fully-functional Rails Port installation depends on other services, including map tile
servers and geocoding services, that are provided by other software. The default installation
uses publicly-available services to help with development and testing.

# Docker for local development
For a standalone ohm-website development server, follow the steps below:

1. Check out this repository to your local machine. Make sure you also have Docker installed. You can get Docker at https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

2. Create a `config/storage.yml` from `config/example.storage.yml` with 
```bash
cp config/example.storage.yml config/storage.yml
```

3. Create a ohm-docker.env from ohm-docker.env.example. If you are using the database as part the docker setup in this repo, leave the defaults. This command is an easy way to do that:
```bash
cp ohm-docker.env.example ohm-docker.env
```
4. Create a config/settings.local.yml from config/settings.yml. This command is an easy way to do that:
```bash
cp config/settings.yml config/settings.local.yml
```

5. Run `docker compose up --build`. 
If you encounter any `SEGFAULT` Code 139 errors, you need to allocate more memory to Docker. Go to the GUI Docker Dashboard > Settings and allocate at least 6GB.

6. Visit http://localhost:3000

7. Create an account using the Sign up link.

8. Follow instructions in the Managing users section of [CONFIGURE.md](https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/blob/master/CONFIGURE.md#managing-users) to activate the user, provide admin privileges, and create OAuth2 tokens for iD and Website. That file also shows how to supply these keys in settings.local.yml. 

To activate user, you'll need to open a bash session in the container, so you can run the Rails commands in the OSM docs. Do that in a new terminal window with `docker exec -it ohm-website-web-1 bash`, then follow the Rails specific commans in CONFIGURE.md.

9. Restart containers by going back to your temrinal where they are running, stopping them with ctrl-C to stop the containers, and then doing `docker compose up` to start them up again.

# Populating Local Data

For testing purposes, it is useful to pull in data from the live OHm or staging website so you can see real-world examples of how the system is handling tags, etc.

Rather than importing a whole planet file, an easy way to do this is to find items on the live website you want to test, export them, and then import them locally.

Some good ways to find relevant content are using https://taginfo.openhistoricalmap.org to find specific keys or values, or using Overpass Turbo for the same purpose, at https://openhistoricalmap.github.io/overpass-turbo.

Once you find a item you want to import, navigate to it on the live website, like at https://staging.openhistoricalmap.org/way/198291609

Open your browser's Dev Tools network panel, then open the Map Layers window on the right side of the OHM website. Select "Map Data" to load the map data from OHM database.

Search the network panel for BBOX and youâ€™ll find an API call like this: https://staging.openhistoricalmap.org/api/0.6/map?bbox=-122.3349925875664,47.59867932091805,-122.33449235558511,47.59930511547229. 

Putting that as the wget [URL] -O map.osm target of the following shell script would get you all the features in that BBOX.

Run this inside the Docker container:

```bash
apt update
apt-get install -y wget

#replace this link with whatever BBOX you want to import. Be sure to retain the flag and filename after the URL
wget https://www.openhistoricalmap.org/api/0.6/map?bbox=-122.33347713947298,47.60143384611086,-122.33222991228105,47.60254791359933 -O map.osm

    psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -h $POSTGRES_HOST -d $POSTGRES_DATABASE -c "select setval('current_ways_id_seq', (select max(way_id) from ways));"
    psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -h $POSTGRES_HOST -d $POSTGRES_DATABASE -c "select setval('current_relations_id_seq', (select max(relation_id) from relations));"
